## Usage
First, you must set your open weather map api key.
Get an API key and run `weather config OPEN_WEATHER_MAP_API_URL --value [your api key here]`
If you want better geo-positioning, get a Bing Maps API Key and run `weather config BING_MAPS_API_KEY --value [your key here]`
## Config
If you do not like the colors and want to turn them off by default, run `weather config NO_COLOR --value true`, and if you want metric by default run `weather config METRIC --value true`
